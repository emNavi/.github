# ***emNavi***
***emNavi*** is an open-source project derived from "***Em***bodied ***Navi***gation". The vision of ***emNavi*** is to re-construct and optimize the navigation-related SoTA (state of the art) algorithms and apply them on robots, especially aerial robots, to promote the implementation of Embodied AI on mobile robots. ***emNavi*** is developed by team from the Department of CS and Department of Automation @Tsinghua University.

***emNavi*** (***Em***bodied ***Navi***gation)，是一个以具身导航-感知-控制任务为主线的开源项目。***emNavi***的目标是优化和重构与导航相关的最前沿算法（包括使用传统优化方法与人工智能方法），并将它们部署在移动端机器人，推动具身智能在移动机器人领域的真正落地。***emNavi***项目由清华大学计算机系/自动化系与超微智导技术团队联合开发维护。
